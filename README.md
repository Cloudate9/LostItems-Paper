# Lost Items

---
Feeling especially means today? How about losing items whenever you take damage? >:)  
It's a nice challenge that dissuades taking damage, but isn't as hard as something like Half Heart Minecraft
challenges (e.g. HHH)

### Commands

Go ahead and discover what commands there are with `/li h`. There aren't many anyway ;)

Permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  lostitems.configure:
    description: If one can configure lost items
    default: op
  lostitems.updater:
    description: If one can view update messages for this plugin
    default: op
```
